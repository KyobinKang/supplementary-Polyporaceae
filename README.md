# Folders

## rCSCS

This folder contains Jupyter notebook and data files for calculating CSCS (Cemical structural and compositional similarity) metric and visualizing it via PCoA plot (Figure 1A). The method and script was originally described in [Brejnrod et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1101/546150)

## MFCount

This folder contains Jupyter notebook and files used to visualize the numbers of molecular families and MS features in each sample (Figure 1B).
